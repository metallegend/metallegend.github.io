<div id="text">

Often referred to as European power metal, Melodic power metal originated from the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, emerging in the late 1980s and
early 1990s with Germany's Helloween, Blind Guardian and Finland's Stratovarius, with a strong focus on melody and uplifting, positive themes. Power
metal is today associated with fast tempo and melodic harmonies, the sound tempered by characteristics of speed metal, power metal's musical
forerunner. Power metal is highly focused on the vocalist, with "clean" vocals being much more prevalent than the growling vocals often associated
with death metal and black metal. Following in the tradition of Ronnie James Dio, Ian Gillan, Bruce Dickinson,Rob Halford and other heavy metal
vocalists, power metal vocals are often in a high register. The majority of the genre's vocalists sing in the tenor range,capable of hitting very 
high notes. 
Helloween one of Melodic power metal's originators mixed fast palm muted speed metal riffs with high-pitched clean vocals. Stratovarius further
developed this melodic direction by making heavy use of keyboards. This genre spread over Europe, often incorporating further influences from
classical and folk music. The style has become one of the most popular metal subgenres, and has many bands outside of Europe.
