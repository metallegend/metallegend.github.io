Funeral Doom
  
</div>
 
<div id="text">

Funeral doom is a style of doom metal that takes influence from both the death/doom and dark ambient genres. It is played at a very slow tempo, and
places an emphasis on evoking a sense of emptiness and despair. Typically, electric guitars are heavily distorted and keyboards or synthesizers are
used to create a "dreamlike" atmosphere. Vocals consist of mournful chants or growls and are often in the background.
