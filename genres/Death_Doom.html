Death/Doom
  
</div>
 
<div id="text">

Death/doom is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal. It combines the slow tempos and pessimistic or depressive mood of doom metal with the deep growling
vocals and double kick drumming of death metal. The genre emerged in the mid 1980s and gained a certain amount of popularity during the 1990s, but
had become less common by the turn of the century. The tag of death/doom seemed to become less popular towards the end of the decade as many of the
scene progenitors abandoned their early sound to embrace a more accessible or palatable direction. However, the style persists in the form of funeral
doom, a highly related genre that emerged in the mid-1990s.
