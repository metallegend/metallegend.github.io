Post Metal

<div id="text">

Post-metal is a music genre, a mixture between the genres of post-rock and heavy metal. It is broadly characterized by downtuned, distorted guitar(s),
heavy atmospherics, gradual evolution of song structure, and a minimal emphasis on vocals. 
Hydra Head Records owner and Isis frontman Aaron Turner originally termed the genre "thinking man's metal", demonstrating that his band was trying to
move away from common metal conventions. "Post-metal" is the favored name for the growing genre, but it is also referred to as "metalgaze" and "steel". 
Journalist Simon Reynolds writes that "the term post-metal seems increasingly useful to describe the vast and variegated swath of genres that emerged
from the early '90s onward. Sometimes beat-free and ambient, increasingly the work of home-studio loners rather than performing bands, post-metal of
the kind released by labels like Hydra Head often seems to have barely any connection to metal as understood by, say, VH1 Classic doc-makers. The
continuity is less sonic but attitudinal: the penchant for morbidity and darkness taken to a sometimes hokey degree; the somber clothing and the
long hair; the harrowed, indecipherably growled vocals; the bombastically verbose lyrics/song titles/band names. It's that aesthetic rather than
a way of riffing or a palette of guitar sounds that ties post-metal back to Judas Priest and Black Sabbath."
