New Wave of American Heavy Metal

<div id="text">

The New Wave of American Heavy Metal is a movement in that originated in the United States during the early to mid 1990s and has expanded most in the
recent 2000s. Some of the bands considered part of the movement had formed as early as the late 1980s, but did not become influential or reach popular
standing until the following decade. The term NWOAHM is a later reference to the New Wave of British Heavy Metal movement of the very early 1980s. 
Although the term is used by the media with increasing frequency, the definition has not been finished completely. This is due in part to the growing
addition of bands that assimilate to common styles in NWOAHM, yet have not differentiated greatly enough as to garner a new genre moniker. One
descriptor by longtime metal author Garry Sharpe-Young helps classify the NWOAHM as a "marriage of European-style riffing and throaty vocals".
Several of the bands within the NWOAHM are credited with bringing heavy metal back into the mainstream.
