Drone Metal

<div id="text">

Drone metal (also known as drone doom) is a style of doom metal that is largely defined by drones; notes or chords that are sustained and repeated
throughout a piece of music. Typically, the electric guitar is performed with large amounts of reverb and feedback while vocals, if present, are
usually growled or screamed. Songs are often very long and lack beat or rhythm in the traditional sense. Drone doom is generally influenced by
drone music, noise music and minimalist music. The style emerged in the early 1990s and was pioneered by Earth, Boris and Sunn O))).
