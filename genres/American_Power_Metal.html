American Power Metal
  
</div>
 
<div id="text">

American Power Metal emerged in 1980s United States, drawing its influences mainly from speed metal and the NWOBHM. Though very close to its roots,
US power metal (often abbreviated USPM) is often faster than standard heavy metal, with a more riff-driven approach than its later European
counterpart, but more melodic and often with a higher emphasis on guitar leads than thrash. Another notable difference is the relative lack of
keyboards in American power metal, in contrast to their almost universal presence in the European variety. USPM is also notable for its wide (but
not universal) use of high-register operatic vocals, a trend which would continue with the rise of European power metal in the late 80s and early
90s. Many major US power metal bands, such as Fates Warning, were also pivotal in pioneering the progressive metal genre. US power metal saw a sharp
decline in popularity at the beginning of the 90s, though the style has rebounded somewhat in the past decade.
