Folk Metal

The earliest exponent of folk metal was the English band Skyclad. Their debut album The Wayward Sons of Mother Earth was released in 1990. It was not
until 1994 and 1995 that other early contributors in the genre began to emerge from different regions of Europe as well as in Israel. Among these early
groups, the Irish band Cruachan and the German band Subway to Sally each spearheaded a different regional variation that over time became known as Celtic
metal and medieval metal respectively. Despite their contributions, folk metal remained little known with few representatives during the 1990s. It was
not until the early 2000s when the genre exploded into prominence, particularly in Finland with the efforts of such groups as Finntroll, Ensiferum,
Korpiklaani, Turisas, and Moonsorrow. 
The music of folk metal is characterised by its diversity with bands known to perform different styles of both heavy metal music and folk music. A
large variety of folk instruments are used in the genre with many bands consequently featuring six or more members in their regular line-ups. A few
bands are also known to rely on keyboards to simulate the sound of folk instruments. Lyrics in the genre commonly deal with paganism, nature, fantasy,
mythology and history.
