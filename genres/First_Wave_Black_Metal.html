First Wave of Black Metal
  
</div>
 
<div id="text">

Black metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal. It often uses fast tempos, shrieked vocals, highly distorted guitars played with tremolo picking,
blast beat drumming, raw recording, and unconventional song structure. 
The first wave of black metal refers to those bands during the 1980s who influenced the black metal sound and formed a prototype for the genre. They
were often speed metal or thrash metal bands. The term "black metal" was coined by the English band Venom with their second album Black Metal (1982).
Although considered thrash metal rather than black metal by modern standards, the album's lyrics and imagery focused more on anti-Christian and Satanic
themes than any before it. Their music was unpolished in production and featured raspy grunted vocals. Venom's members also adopted pseudonyms, a
practice that would become widespread among black metal musicians. 
Another major influence on black metal was the Swedish band Bathory, led by Thomas Forsberg (under the pseudonym Quorthon). Not only did Bathory use
unpolished production and anti-Christian themes, but Quorthon was also the first to use the "shrieked" vocals that came to define black metal.
