Mathcore

<div id="text">

Mathcore is a rhythmically complex and dissonant style of metalcore. It has its roots in bands such as Converge, Botch, and the Dillinger Escape Plan.
The term mathcore is suggested by analogy with math rock. Both math rock and mathcore make use of unusual time signatures. Math rock groups have some
influence on mathcore, though mathcore is more closely related to metalcore. Prominent mathcore groups have been associated with grindcore. 
An early antecedent to mathcore was practiced by Black Flag, in 1984, with the album My War: "Its seven-minute metal dirges and fusion-style time
signatures proved too much for many fans". Many groups from the mathcore scene paid tribute to Black Flag for the album Black on Black. 
Stewart-Panko described the sound of these bands as a "dynamic, violent, discordant, technical, brutal, off-kilter, no rules mixture of metal,
hardcore, prog, math rock, grind and jazz." However, this term also describes an earlier, more dissonant variant of grindcore, also known as
"noisegrind", that is less complex and dynamic than the groups subsequently labeled mathcore.
