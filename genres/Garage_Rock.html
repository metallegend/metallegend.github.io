Garage Rock

<div id="text">

Garage rock is a raw form of rock and roll that was first popular in the United States and Canada from about 1963 to 1967. During the 1960s, it was
not recognized as a separate music genre and had no specific name. In the late 1970s, some rock critics retroactively identified it as an early
incarnation of punk rock, and it is sometimes called garage punk, protopunk, or 1960s punk; however, the music style has predominantly been
referred to as garage rock. 
The garage rock performances were most of the time characterized as being amateurish or naïve. Common themes were related to the negative aspects of
high school life and the lyrics and delivery were quite a bit more aggressive than what was common at the time, often with growled or shouted vocals
that often seemed to be more like screaming. A particularly common type of songs were songs about "lying girls". This might imply that the music was
very limited. However, in reality different garage rock acts were quite diverse in both musical ability and in style. Bands varied from one-chord
musical crudeness to near-studio musician quality. Also there were regional variations in many parts of the country with the Pacific Northwest states
of Washington and Oregon having the most defined regional sound.
