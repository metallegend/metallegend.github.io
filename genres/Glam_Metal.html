Glam Metal

<div id="text">

Glam metal (also known as hair metal and often used synonymously with pop metal) is a subgenre of hard rock and heavy metal that arose in the late
1970s and early 1980s in the United States, particularly on the Los Angeles Sunset Strip music scene. It was popular throughout the 1980s and the
beginning of the 1990s, combining the flamboyant look of glam rock and playing a power-chord-based heavy metal musical style. 
Musically, glam metal uses traditional hard rock and heavy metal songs, incorporating elements of punk rock, while adding pop-influenced catchy hooks
and guitar riffs. Like other heavy metal songs of the 1980s, they often feature shred guitar solos. Aesthetically glam metal draws heavily on the
glam rock or glitter rock of the 1970s, often with very long backcombed hair, use of make-up, gaudy clothing and accessories (chiefly consisting of
tight denim or leather jeans, spandex, and headbands). The visual aspects of glam metal appealed to music television producers, particularly MTV,
whose establishment coincided with the rise of the genre. Glam metal performers became infamous for their debauched lifestyles of late-night parties,
which were widely covered in the tabloid press. 
The genre rapidly lost mainstream interest from 1991 to 1993 with the rise of grunge and the release of albums such as Nirvana's Nevermind. It
experienced a partial resurgence around the turn of the century, due in part to increased interest on the internet, with the successful 'Glam Slam
Metal Jam' music festival taking place in summer 2000.
