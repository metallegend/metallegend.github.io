</div>
 
<div id="text">

A subgenre of folk metal characterised by the use of oriental folk music styles. The progressive metal outfit Orphaned Land was formed in 1991 in
Israel with their first and only demo The Beloved's Cry released in 1993, "immediately creating a media stir" that "quickly drew attention to their
unorthodox style." Members of the group were still teenagers when they released their debut album Sahara in 1994. The music of Orphaned Land "borrow
heavily from Middle Eastern music styles" with traditional elements coming from both Jewish and Arabic folk music. Acclaimed as "one of the world's
most unique and trailblazing heavy metal bands," Orphaned Land's style of music has since been dubbed oriental metal.
