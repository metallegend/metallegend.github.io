Swedish Death Metal
  
</div>
 
<div id="text">

Swedish death metal is a death metal music scene developed in Sweden. Many Swedish death metal bands are associated with the melodic death metal
movement, thus giving Swedish death metal a different sound from other variations of death metal. Unlike American death metal groups, the first
Swedish bands were rooted in punk rock. While Norway is more notorious for its quantity of black metal, Gothenburg in Sweden has a large melodic
death metal scene, while Stockholm is notorious for its rawer death metal scene. 
The death metal scene in Sweden has influenced many bands and genres outside Sweden. The melodic influence of the Gothenburg sound has spread to the
United States to more hardcore punk and metalcore groups. The Stockholm Sound has been known to be very influenced by the first Entombed album as
bands such as Autopsy, Death and Repulsion. The Stockholm Sound has less reception. Melodic death metal, on the other hand has had a notable influence
on the melodic metalcore sound of the 2000's.
