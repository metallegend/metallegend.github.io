Neue Deutsche Harte

<div id="text">

Neue Deutsche Härte ("new German hardness") is a term invented by the German music press after the release of the debut album Herzeleid (1995) by
Rammstein. It describes a Crossover style that is influenced by German rock, hard rock, and groove metal/alternative metal combining it with elements
from electronic music and techno. The lyrics are generally in German. It uses the basic setup of instruments for metal, electric guitar, bass guitar,
drums and vocals, with keyboard, synthesisers and samples. Emphasis is on a demonstration of predominance, by over-pronouncing certain syllables and
letters (such as the uvular trill). The vocals are thus dominantly presenting in deep, male, and clean voice.
