<div id="text">

Deathrash was spawned in the late 80's and consists of a thick mix of death metal and thrash metal. The hellish sounds of the bands within this
movement are made up of heavy, dark and brooding guitar sounds with thrashy drumming and evil vocals which are usually a mix between the
traditional black metal shrieks and death metal lows. Around the world, Deathrash is the moniker for the bands following these attributes.
