Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal. It typically employs heavily distorted guitars, tremolo picking, deep growling vocals, blast beat
drumming, minor keys or atonality, and complex song structures with multiple tempo changes. 
Building from the musical structure of thrash metal and early black metal, death metal emerged during the mid 1980s. English heavy metal band Venom
crystallized the elements of what later became known as thrash metal, death metal and black metal, with their 1981 album Welcome to Hell. Their dark,
blistering sound, harsh vocals, and macabre, proudly Satanic imagery proved a major inspiration for extreme metal bands. Metal acts such as Slayer,
Kreator, Celtic Frost were very important influences to the crafting of the genre. Along with the band Death and its frontman Chuck Schuldiner, who
is often referred to as "the father of death metal", bands such as Possessed, Obituary and Morbid Angel are often considered pioneers of the genre. 
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, death metal gained more media attention as popular record labels like Earache and Roadrunner began to sign death
metal bands at a rapid rate. Since then, death metal has diversified, spawning a variety of subgenres.
