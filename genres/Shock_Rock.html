Shock Rock
  
</div>
 
<div id="text">

Shock rock is a wide umbrella term for artists who combine rock music with elements of theatrical shock value in live performances. With a career
spanning the mid-1960s to recent years, American band leader Alice Cooper, inspired by such artists as Arthur Brown, refined shock rock, with
expensive, upscale illusionary, graphic stunts, such as feigning decapitation with the use of elaborate special effects. In the early 1970s, Cooper's
unique blend of heavy metal and folk-blues, complete with sardonic and inevitably controversial lyrics, proved a powerful inspiration for many future
genre artists such as KISS of the mid 1970s, Glam metal of the '80s and Marilyn Manson of the 1990s. Alice Cooper is the one who has been credited for
inventing true shock rock, as well as trade-marking shock rock.
