Speed Metal

Speed metal is a sub-genre of heavy metal music that originated in the late 1970s from NWOBHM and hardcore punk roots. It is described as "extremely
fast, abrasive, and technically demanding" music. 
Motörhead is often credited as the first band to invent/play speed metal. Some of speed metal's earlier influences include Deep Purple's "Fireball"
and Queen's "Stone Cold Crazy", from their 1974 album Sheer Heart Attack, and Deep Purple's song "Highway Star", from their album Machine Head. The
latter was called 'early speed metal' by Robb Reiner of speed metal band Anvil. Led Zeppelin's "Communication Breakdown", first released in January
1969, could also be said to be an early template for speed metal. 
Speed metal eventually evolved into thrash metal. Although many tend to equate the two subgenres, there is a distinct difference between them. In his
book Sound of the Beast: The Complete Headbanging History of Heavy Metal, Ian Christe states that "...thrash metal relies more on long, wrenching
rhythmic breaks, while speed metal... is a cleaner and more musically intricate subcategory, still loyal to the dueling melodies of classic metal."
