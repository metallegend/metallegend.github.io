Progressive Metal

<div id="text">

Progressive metal (sometimes known as prog metal) is a subgenre of heavy metal, which blends the powerful, guitar-driven sound of metal with the
complex compositional structures, odd time signatures, and intricate instrumental playing of progressive rock. Many progressive metal bands are
also influenced by jazz fusion and classical music. Like progressive rock songs, progressive metal songs are typically much longer than standard
metal songs, and are often thematically linked in concept albums. 
Although progressive metal and avant-garde metal both favor experimentation and non-standard ideas, there are rather large differences between the
two genres. The experimentation of progressive metal has a strong emphasis on technicality and theoretical complexity (influenced by jazz music).
This is done by playing complex rhythms and implementing unusual time signatures and song structures - all with the use of traditional instruments.
For avant-garde metal, most of the experimentation is in the use of unusual sounds and instruments - being more unorthodox and questioning of
musical conventions.
