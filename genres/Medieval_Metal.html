<div id="text">

Medieval metal or medieval rock is a subgenre of folk metal that blends hard rock or heavy metal music with medieval folk music. Medieval metal is
mostly restricted to Germany where it is known as Mittelalter-Metal or Mittelalter-Rock. The genre emerged from the middle of the 1990s with
contributions from Subway to Sally, In Extremo and Schandmaul. The style is characterised by the prominent use of a wide variety of traditional
folk and medieval instruments. 
Like its parent genre, medieval rock features the same typical instruments found in heavy metal music: guitars, bass, drums and vocalist. Bands in
the genre are known to supplement their sound with a wide range of folk and traditional instruments. Woodwind instruments like the bagpipes, flutes
and shawm, string instruments like the violin, lute, hurdy gurdy, cello, harp and mandolin. Bands in the genre are also known to sing mostly or only
in German, including Subway to Sally, Morgenstern and Letzte Instanz.
