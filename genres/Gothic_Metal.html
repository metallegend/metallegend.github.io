Gothic Metal

<div id="text">

Gothic metal or goth metal is a sub-genre of heavy metal music that combines the aggression of doom metal with the dark melancholy of gothic rock.
The music of gothic metal is diverse with bands known to adopt the gothic approach to different styles of heavy metal music. The genre originated
during the early 1990s in Europe originally as an outgrowth of doom/death, a fusion of death metal and doom metal. Lyrics are generally melodramatic
and mournful with inspiration from gothic fiction as well as personal experiences. 
Norwegian band Theatre of Tragedy developed the "beauty and the beast" aesthetic of combining aggressive male vocals with clean female vocals, a
contrast that has since been adopted by many gothic metal groups. During the mid-1990s, a number of bands brought the gothic approach to black metal.
By the end of the decade, a symphonic metal variant of gothic metal had been developed. 
In the 21st century, gothic metal has moved towards the mainstream in Europe, particularly in Finland where a number of groups have released hit
singles or chart-topping albums. In the US, however, only a few bands such as HIM, Lacuna Coil, and Evanescence have found commercial success.
