Melodic Death Metal
  
</div>
 
<div id="text">

Melodic death metal (also referred to as melodeath) is a musical style, a subgenre of death metal which combines the melody of the new wave of British
heavy metal with the intensity of death metal. The genre is also known as Gothenburg metal, a reference to the city in Sweden where it
originated. Originally the genre combined the harmony style and groove melodies of heavy metal with the harsh thrashing sound and vocals of death
metal. Later the genre evolved due to many different influences; a notable evolution in the genre being the addition of keyboards. Melodic death
metal contains more melodic guitar riffs, melodic solos, and occasionally acoustic guitar work rather than traditional death metal.
