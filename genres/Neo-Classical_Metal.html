Neo-Classical Metal
  
</div>
 
<div id="text">

Neo-classical metal is a subgenre of heavy metal music that is heavily influenced by classical music. It refers to a very technical performance
consisting of elements borrowed from both classical and heavy metal music. Yngwie Malmsteen, the most notable musician in the sub-genre, contributed
greatly to the development of the style in the 1980s. 
The "golden age" of neo-classical metal in the middle to late 1980s revolved around the sizable roster of flashy electric-guitar soloists who
recorded mostly instrumental albums for Mike Varney's Shrapnel Records label. Swedish guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen, widely regarded as the originator
and still-reigning king of neo-classical metal, was brought to the United States by Varney to sign with Shrapnel Records in 1982. Malmsteen drew
influence from both rock and classical idioms from a young age in developing his hyper-amplified, hyper-fast technique on the electric guitar;
Malmsteen's style in turn inspired countless imitators from the moment his earliest Shrapnel recordings appeared.
