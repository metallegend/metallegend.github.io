<div id="text">

Alternative metal is a genre of heavy metal that gained popularity in the early 1990s and combines Heavy Metal with Alternative Rock. Most notably,
alternative metal bands are characterized by heavy guitar riffs; typically, these riffs have a pronounced experimental edge, including unconventional
lyrics, odd time signatures, more syncopation than typical metal, unusual technique, a resistance to conventional approaches to heavy music and an
incorporation of a wide range of influences outside of the metal music scene.
