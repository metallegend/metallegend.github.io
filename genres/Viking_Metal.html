Viking Metal

<div id="text">

Viking metal is a subgenre of heavy metal music characterised by its galloping pace, keyboard-rich anthemic sound, bleakness and dramatic emphasis on
Norse mythology, Norse paganism, and the Viking Age. Viking metal is "noisy, chaotic, and often augmented by sorrowful keyboard melodies." Like folk
metal bands, Viking metal acts "generally utilize some acoustic and other unusual instruments in addition to the traditional metal instruments." 
The genre of Viking metal was pioneered by the Swedish band Bathory. The band's fourth album Blood Fire Death was released in 1988 and includes
two early examples of Viking metal – the songs "A Fine Day to Die" and "Blood Fire Death". Eduardo Rivadavia of Allmusic describes this as "possibly
the first true example" of Viking metal. It was followed in 1990 with the release of Hammerheart, a landmark album that "formally introduced" to the
metal world the "archetypical Viking metal album." By then the band had completely departed from "the Satanic mould" and was "squarely in Viking
mythology." The Viking metal music of Bathory was characterised by Wagnerian "lengthy epics, ostentatious arrangements, chorused vocals, and ambient
keyboards."
