Blackened Death Metal
  
</div>
 
<div id="text">

Black/Death sometimes reffered to by the term "blackened death metal" sounds like something you'd order at a cafe in hell, but of course it refers to
death metal with black metal influences. There are often bands out there who do not completely fit into either Black Metal or Death Metal. These bands
fall into what the metal community calls blackened death metal. It is traditionally a mix between the two styles. Basically, blackened death metal
tends to have the death grunts mixed in with black metal playing styles. Other times, you will hear the black metal style blast beat accompanied with
death grunts or the slow pounding guitar rhythms. It is sometimes described as a catch all for the bands that do not fall into one of the two parent
genres specifically.
