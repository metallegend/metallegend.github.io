Hard Rock

<div id="text">

Hard rock (or heavy rock) is a loosely defined genre of rock music which has its earliest roots in mid-1960s garage rock, blues rock and psychedelic
rock. Hard rock is a form of loud, aggressive rock music. The electric guitar is often emphasised, used with distortion and other effects, both as a
rhythm instrument using simple repetitive riffs, and as a solo lead instrument. Drumming characteristically focuses on driving rhythms, strong bass
drum and a backbeat on snare, sometimes using cymbals for emphasis. 
In the late 1960s the term heavy metal was used interchangeably with hard rock, but gradually began to be used to describe music played with even more
volume and intensity. While hard rock maintained a bluesy rock and roll identity, including some swing in the back beat and riffs that tended to
outline chord progressions in their hooks, heavy metal's riffs often functioned as stand-alone melodies and had no swing in them. 
Hard rock developed into a major form of popular music in the 1970s, with bands like Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, Aerosmith, AC/DC and Van Halen, and
reached a commercial peak in the mid 1980s. The glam metal of bands like Bon Jovi and Def Leppard and the rawer sounds of Guns N' Roses followed up
with great success in the later part of that decade, before losing popularity in the face of grunge. Despite this, many post-grunge bands adopted a
hard rock sound and in the 2000s there came a renewed interest in established bands, attempts at a revival, and new hard rock bands that emerged from
the garage rock and post punk revival.
