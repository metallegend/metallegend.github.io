Crust Punk
  
</div>
 
<div id="text">

Crust punk (often simply crust) is a form of music influenced by anarcho-punk, hardcore punk and extreme metal. The style, which evolved in the
mid-1980s in England, often has songs with dark and pessimistic lyrics that linger on political and social ills. The lyrical content of crust punk
tends to be bleak and nihilistic, yet politically engaged. Crust punk songs are often about nuclear war, militarism, animal rights, police, personal
grievances and oppressive states and fascism. Amebix were also interested in various forms of mysticism and Gnosticism. 
Crust is partly defined by its "bassy" and "dirty" sound. It is often played at a fast tempo with occasional slow sections. Vocals are usually
guttural and may be growled or screamed. Crust punk takes cues from the anarcho-punk of Crass and Discharge, the extreme metal of bands like
Venom and Celtic Frost and, in some of its more dissonant strains, subtle elements of post-punk via Killing Joke. Crust punk has always remained a
deeply underground form of music, although fans of the style are found worldwide.
