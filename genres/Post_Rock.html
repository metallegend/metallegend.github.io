Post Rock
  
</div>
 
<div id="text">

Post-rock is a subgenre of alternative rock characterized by the use of instruments commonly associated with rock music, but using rhythms, harmonies,
melodies, timbres, and chord progressions not traditionally found in rock. Post-rock musicians typically produce instrumental music. 
Don Caballero and Tortoise were among the more prominent bands described as post-rock in the 1990s, but their styles are very different, despite being
instrumental bands centered on guitars and drums. As such, the term has been the subject of backlash from listeners and artists alike. The term
"post-rock" is believed to have been coined by critic Simon Reynolds in his review of Bark Psychosis' album Hex, published in the March 1994 issue of
Mojo magazine. Reynolds expanded upon the idea later in the May 1994 issue of The Wire. 
He used the term to describe music "using rock instrumentation for non-rock purposes, using guitars as facilitators of timbre and textures rather than
riffs and power chords". He further expounded on the term, "Perhaps the really provocative area for future development lies... in cyborg rock; not the
wholehearted embrace of Techno's methodology, but some kind of interface between real time, hands-on playing and the use of digital effects and
enhancement." 
Reynolds, in a July 2005 entry in his blog, claimed he had used the term "post-rock" before using it in Mojo, previously using it in music newspaper
Melody Maker. He also said he later found the term to not be of his own creation, saying in his blog, "although I genuinely believed I was coining the
term, I discovered many years later it had been floating around for over a decade." The term was used by American journalist James Wolcott in a 1975
article about musician Todd Rundgren, although with a different meaning. It was also used in the Rolling Stone Album Guide to name a style roughly
corresponding to "avant-rock" or "out-rock". 
Although firmly rooted in the indie or underground scene of the 1980s and '90s, post-rock's style often bears little resemblance musically to that of
indie rock.
