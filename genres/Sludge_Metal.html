Sludge Metal

<div id="text">

Sludge metal, or just sludge,[citation needed] is a subgenre of heavy metal that melds the slow tempos, heavy rhythms and dark, pessimistic atmosphere
of doom metal with the aggression, shouted vocals and occasional fast tempos of hardcore punk. As The New York Times put it, "The shorthand term for
the kind of rock descending from early Black Sabbath and late Black Flag is sludge, because it's so slow and dense." Sludge metal is typically abrasive;
often featuring shouted vocals, heavily distorted instruments and sharply contrasting tempos. While the style was anticipated by the Melvins from
Washington, many of its earliest pioneers were from the state of Louisiana. 
Many sludge metal bands from the Southern United States incorporate Southern rock and blues influence, although not all sludge bands share this style.
There is some controversy as to whether the term refers to only the style emerging from New Orleans and later the American South more broadly, or to
"a complete consciousness in the heads of like-minded Black Flag/Black Sabbath influenced scenes and individuals all over the world". So-called
"atmospheric" sludge bands adopt a more experimental approach and compose music with an ambient atmosphere, reduced aggression and philosophical
lyrics. Due to the similarities between sludge and stoner metal, there is often a crossover between the two genres, but sludge metal generally
avoids stoner metal's usage of psychedelia. Sludge metal also bears some musical and lyrical resemblance to crust punk, due to the usage of political
lyrics and thick, "dirty" guitar sounds.
