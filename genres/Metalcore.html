Metalcore is a fusion genre combining various elements of extreme metal and hardcore punk. The name of it is a portmanteau of the names of the two
genres. The term took on its current meaning in the mid-1990s. The earliest of these groups, Integrity, began performing in 1988. Metalcore is
distinguished from other punk metal fusions by its emphasis on breakdowns: slower, intense passages conducive to moshing. The vocalizing technique
in metalcore is generally screamed vocals, particularly common among many 1990s metalcore groups. Today many metalcore bands combine screaming vocals
with the usage of clean vocals usually during the bridge or chorus of a song. The genre has had a saturation of bands in the last five years. Sepultura
has been credited to "lay the foundation" for the genre.
