Original Hardcore Punk
  
</div>
 
<div id="text">

Hardcore punk is an underground music genre that originated in the late 1970s, following the mainstream success of punk rock. Hardcore is generally
faster, thicker, and heavier than earlier punk rock. The origin of the term hardcore punk is uncertain. The Vancouver-based band D.O.A. may have
helped to popularize the term with the title of their 1981 album, Hardcore '81. 
Hardcore has spawned the straight edge movement and its associated submovements, hardline and youth crew. Hardcore was heavily involved with the rise
of the independent record labels in the 1980s, and with the do it yourself (DIY) ethos in underground music scenes. It has influenced several music
genres which have experienced mainstream success, such as: metalcore, grunge, thrash metal, emo and post-hardcore. 
Hardcore sprouted underground scenes across the United States in the early 1980s — particularly in Washington, D.C., California, New York/New Jersey,
and Boston — as well as in the United Kingdom. While traditional hardcore has never experienced mainstream commercial success, some of its early
pioneers have garnered appreciation over time.
