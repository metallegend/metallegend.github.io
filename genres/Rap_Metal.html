Rap metal is a subgenre of rap rock and genre of heavy metal fusing vocal and sometimes instrumental elements of hip hop with heavy metal. Rap metal
originated from rap rock, a genre fusing vocal and instrumental elements of hip hop with rock. The genre's roots are based both in hip hop acts who
sampled heavy metal songs, such as Beastie Boys, Cypress Hill and Run-D.M.C., as well as rock bands who fused heavy metal and hip hop influences.
Stuck Mojo, a metal band whose vocalist rapped, is considered to be one of the pioneers of the genre.
