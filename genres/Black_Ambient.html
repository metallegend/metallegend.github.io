Black Ambient

<div id="text">

Ambient black metal is a style that combines elements of black metal and ambient/dark ambient music. Typically the electric guitar is played together
with synthesizers and keyboards, or simply in an 'atmospheric' style with much use of reverb. 
The Norwegian artist Varg Vikernes with his one man band Burzum, may be considered a pioneer of black ambient (having also performed in traditional
dark ambient). During his time in prison, Vikernes recorded two albums (Dauði Baldrs and Hliðskjálf), which are composed of dark ambient songs.
Vikernes was denied access to an electric guitar, bass guitar or drums, and instead used a synthesizer and a tape recorder.
