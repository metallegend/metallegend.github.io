Traditional Doom Metal
  
</div>
 
<div id="text">

Doom metal is an extreme form of heavy metal music that typically uses slower tempos, low-tuned guitars and a much "thicker" or "heavier" sound than
other metal genres. Both the music and the lyrics intend to evoke a sense of despair, dread, and impending doom. Doom metal is among the oldest forms
of heavy metal, rooted in the music of early Black Sabbath. Black Sabbath's music is itself stylistically rooted in blues, but with the deliberately
doomy and loud guitar playing of Tony Iommi (who often used the tritone), and the then-uncommon dark and pessimistic lyrics and atmosphere, they set
the standards of early heavy metal and inspired various doom metal bands to come. 
In the early 1970s both Black Sabbath and the American band Pentagram composed and performed this heavy and dark music, which would in the 1980s begin
to be known and referred to as doom metal by subsequent musicians, critics and fans. During the first half of the 1980s, a number of bands from England,
the United States and Sweden defined doom metal as a distinct genre. Slower, heavier and pessimistic in its nature, doom metal bands did not receive
much attention even among die-hard metal fans of that time. 
At the beginning of the 1990s, experimentation within doom metal became widespread, and the genre diversified as a result. Today, bands who continue
the style of the genre's pioneers are often referred to as traditional doom metal. Traditional doom metal bands more commonly use higher guitar
tunings, and do not play as slow as many other doom bands. Traditional doom bands typically play slow to mid-tempo songs with a thick and heavy
sound. Vocals are usually clean with the occasional growl or scream. The lyrics in traditional doom usually are eerie and dark like other doom
metal divisions.
