South American Death Metal
  
</div>
 
<div id="text">

South America has a long history of metal bands. The first South American metal bands originated during the 1980s in Brazil. The Brazillian Thrash
metal scene was one of the major scenes of thrash metal in the 1980s. In Belo Horizonte, Brazil, the scene had some of the most extreme bands, close
to what became known as death metal. Bands such as Sepultura, Sarcófago and Mutilator continued further and were in some ways more extreme than the
German Teoutonic thrash. The band Sarcófago has influenced most of the European black metal and death metal bands. In the late 80s Brazillian band
Sepultura had success outside of Brazil. 
Colombian bands such as Parabellum and Reencarnacion had a big influence on the underground black/death metal scene worldwide including an influence
on Norwegian black metal band Mayhem.
