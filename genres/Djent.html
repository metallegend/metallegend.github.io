Djent

<div id="text">

Founded by Meshuggah djent has not yet been classed by many as a true, distinct genre on its own, often been referred to as avant-garde, progressive,
math or even death metal. The word djent was coined by Meshuggah's Fredrik Thordendal, and is commonly used to describe bands that use a particular
guitar tone, Bulb (a.k.a. Misha Mansoor) says it best: "The onomatopoeia of a heavily palm muted distorted guitar chord which is usually played as
but not limited to a 4 string double octave powerchord, and as a result sounds much more metallic and sonically present than a 'chug' 'chugga' or
'djun' per se, and which is basically how Periphery would describe its palm muted guitar sound."
