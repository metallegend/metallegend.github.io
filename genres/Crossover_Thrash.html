Crossover Thrash
  
</div>
 
<div id="text">

Crossover thrash metal, often abbreviated to crossover, is a form of thrash metal that contains more hardcore punk elements than standard thrash. It
is sometimes referred to as punk metal, though this is generally incorrect due to the existence of other music genres that combine forms of punk rock
and heavy metal, such as grunge and crust punk. While thrash metal is heavily influenced by hardcore punk, the overall sound of crossover thrash is
more punk-influenced yet more metal-sounding and aggressive than traditional hardcore punk and thrashcore. 
Crossover thrash evolved when performers in hardcore punk and heavy metal began borrowing elements of one another's music. Punk-based metal bands
generally evolved into the genre by developing more musical technique than the average hardcore outfit, and getting bored with the musical limitations
of "pure" hardcore (which focused on very fast tempos and very brief songs). Especially early on, crossover thrash had a strong affinity with skate
punk, but gradually became more and more the province of metal audiences.
