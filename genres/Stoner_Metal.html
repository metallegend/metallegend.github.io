Stoner Metal
  
</div>
 
<div id="text">

Stoner metal is a sub-genre of heavy metal that combines elements of psychedelic rock, blues-rock, traditional heavy metal and doom metal. Stoner
metal is typically slow-to-mid tempo and features low-tuned guitars, a bass-heavy sound, melodic vocals, and 'retro' production. Stoner metal bands
updated the long, mind-bending jams and ultra-heavy riffs of bands like Black Sabbath, Blue Cheer, Blue Öyster Cult, and Hawkwind by filtering their
psychedelia-tinged metal and acid rock through the buzzing sound of early Sub Pop-style grunge. The genre emerged during the early 1990s and was
pioneered foremost by the Californian bands Kyuss and Sleep. 
A number of bands have combined stoner metal with typical sludge metal traits such as Bongzilla and High on Fire. Often their material is related to
marijuana and promotes its legalization.
