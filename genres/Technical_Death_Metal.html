Technical Death Metal

<div id="text">

Technical death metal (sometimes called tech death) is a musical subgenre of death metal that focuses on complex rhythms, riffs and song structures.
Technical experimentation in death metal began in the late '80s and early '90s. In 1989, Atheist's debut album Piece of Time was released, followed
by Nocturnus' The Key, in 1990. In 1991, Death released Human. This and later Death albums have proven influential on '90s technical death metal bands.
In 1991, New York's grindcore-influenced Suffocation released the Effigy of the Forgotten debut album, which focused on speed and brutality with
"sophisticated" sense of songwriting and subsequently became groundbreaking in the genre. 
Phil Freeman, ex-editor of Metal Edge, has described the sub-genre of technical death metal as "the hidden side of its genre, having more in common
with prog-rock and jazz fusion than with the mechanistic, Satan-obsessed grinding that's the music's dominant public image." Often technical death
metal albums feature exotic or sci-fi imagery.
